Use case:
Scan through the hosts in inventory to see how many are ping-able and have the report generated in a csv format.Site administrator goes through the report and adds a flag if a host needs to be configured to acccept pings.
The flag is to be enabled in an appropriate column in the csv file.

Solution:
2 play books are used.
1. To generate the csv report, locally on the control node.
2. A playbook to scan through the flags set by admin, based on which the host is configured to respond to ICMP pings. 

Playbooks tested on:
ansible 2.0.1.0
ansible-tower-2.4.5-1
